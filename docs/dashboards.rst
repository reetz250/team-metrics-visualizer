Dashboards
==========

The ``dashboards``-package contains the dashboards which appear in the navigation bar of 
team metrics visualizer.
Each dashboard is a subclass of the abstract base-class ``DashboardController``.
It initializes all visuals contained in the dashboard and connects them to slicers 
through callbacks. 
See the documentation for ``DashboardController`` on how to create a new dashboard.
